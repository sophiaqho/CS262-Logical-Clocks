# CS262-Logical-Clocks

We require time, argparse, socket, math and unittest packages. We have Python 3.7+ installed on computers.

To run the simulation, run 'python3 server.py' and then create THREE terminals in this document
space and run 'python3 client.py' in EACH of these additional terminals (4 total terminals). Log files
will be saved to the same folder with "Process1_....", "Process2_...." and "Process3_...." with the 
timestamp. 

To test the client code,  run 'python3 server.py test' and then run 'python3 test_client.py'
To test the server code, run 'python3 test_server.py'.
